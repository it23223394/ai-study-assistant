## 🎯 30-SECOND INTERVIEW PITCH

"I built an AI Study Assistant that helps students learn efficiently. Students upload their course PDFs and can ask unlimited questions. I use Retrieval-Augmented Generation: the system embeds the PDF chunks, finds relevant ones through semantic search, and has an LLM answer using only those chunks. This prevents hallucinations because the AI can't reference anything outside the PDF. The whole system runs in 5 minutes and costs about $1 per student per semester."
