## 🎤 Key Interview Talking Points

### Problem Statement
"Students spend hours rereading PDFs to find answers. They need instant, accurate explanations grounded in their course material."

### Your Solution
"I built an AI Study Assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Students upload a PDF, I process it into embeddings, and then I can instantly answer questions by retrieving relevant sections and using an LLM to explain."

### Why It's Smart
"This uses RAG to prevent hallucinations - the AI can only answer from the PDF, not make things up. The prompt engineering ensures educational, step-by-step responses."

### Technical Depth
"The system extracts PDF text, creates smart chunks with overlap (500 chars, 100 char overlap) for better context, embeds them using OpenAI, and uses cosine similarity to find the top 3 most relevant chunks for each question. I then pass these to GPT-3.5-turbo with a carefully engineered system prompt."

### Real-World Considerations
"I handled PDF parsing edge cases, optimized API costs (~$1 per student per semester), and made sure the UI is intuitive with source attribution so students can verify answers."
